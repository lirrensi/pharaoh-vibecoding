> Reference to look into:
- `docs/product.md` => The spec for the whole product/repo. Human readable quick explanation of how it works, what it is - product definition on high level. Contains the soul of this thing. Short and without much specifics.
- `docs/arch*.md` => Machine written complete reference of all code/decisions/api... Everything we have is defined there as canon. Serve as a complete spec. You can throw away the code and rewrite completely based on those docs.
Code derived from this documentation. Could be single file or folder.
Also other docs/ may be present -> check at root level and subfolders for modules.
